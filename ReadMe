"h": turn on/off all the green triangles
"j": turn on/off all the red triangles (not working in 4 solids morphing, since there are no red ones)
"k": turn on/off all the blue quads
"B": morph between 2 or 4 meshes (default to 2 meshes morphing, i.e. Part B on start up)
"n": 4 meshes morphing using neville
"b": 4 meshes morphing using bezier

"SPACE": rotate camera
"z" and move mouse: zoom in/out
drag mouse on profile points: change point locations
"i" and press mouse on profile edge's mid point: insert point of profile
"d" and press mouse on profile vertex: delete point of profile
"o" and drag mouse: rotate the current mesh
"c": convexify the current profile
"1"~"4": make camera and profile to focus on the corresponding solid
"," and ".": minus/add sampling
"f": make the camera to follow the morphing
